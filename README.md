# 🔴 Red Line Project – AI-Based Alert and Monitoring System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Red Line Project** is an intelligent AI-powered system built to monitor, detect, and alert when unauthorized or dangerous line-crossing activity occurs in real-time. This is particularly useful for:

- 🚧 Construction sites
- 🚆 Railway platforms
- 🏫 School boundaries
- 🏭 Industrial safety zones

The system uses computer vision techniques to detect when someone crosses a "red line" (virtual or physical) and sends alerts instantly.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Real-time video feed monitoring using OpenCV
- 🚨 Red line detection and crossing alert
- 🔊 Sound alert or email/SMS notification on line breach
- 📊 Simple GUI for visualization
- 💾 Optional log saving for analysis
